# ViSnowlizer

ViSnowlizer is a real-time snow particle visualizer that lets users customize their own digital snowfall. You can adjust particle count, speed, size, color, opacity, wobble, and background to create anything from gentle drifting snow to intense blizzards, that were all rendered smoothly on a full-screen canvas.
